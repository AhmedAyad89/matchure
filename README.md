matchure
============

Matchure is pattern matching for clojure.

* sequence destructuring
* Map destructuring
* equality checks
* regexp matches
* variable binding
* instance checking
* arbitrary boolean expressions
* boolean operators (and, or, not)
* if, when, cond, fn, and defn variants

Matchure is pretty fast too â€“ all patterns matches are compiled to nested if statements at compile time. 

Usage
--------

### Equality

Basic values check for equality

    (if-match [nil nil] true) ;=> true
    (if-match [1 1] true) ;=> true
    (if-match ["asdf" "asdf"] true) ;=> true
    (let [s "asdf"]
      (if-match ["asdf" s] true)) ;=> true

### Wildcards

`_` and `?` are both wildcards and will match anything. `_` is idiomatic for clojure.

`?` has special meaning in matchure. `?` can
be thought of as the thing being matched against, and so by itself always succeeds. It is also used to store the matched value in a variable
and is substituted into function calls for arbitrary tests (examples below).

### Regular expressions

Regular expression literals check for a match

    (if-match [#"hello" "hello world"] true) ;=> true

### Type checking

Fully qualified class/interface names check `instance?`.

    (if-match [java.lang.String "foo"] true) ;=> true
    (if-match [java.lang.Comparable "foo"] true) ;=> true

### Variable binding

The form `?var` is a pattern which always succeeds and has the side effect of binding the matched-against value to the variable `var`.

    (if-match [?foo "bar"] foo) ;=> "bar"

### Sequence destructuring

Literal vectors destructure and match sequences.

    (if-match [[?fst & ?rst] [1 2 3]] [fst rst]) ;=> [1 (2 3)]
    (if-match [[:message ?value] [:message "foo"]] value) ;=> "foo"
    (if-match [[java.lang.String java.lang.String] (list "hello" "world")] true) ;=> true
    (if-match [[[?a] ?b & ?rest] [[1] 2 3 4]] (list a b rest)) ;=> (1 2 (3 4))
    
    ; can also destructure maps
    (if-match [[[?key ?value] & ?rest] (sorted-map 1 2)] [key value rest]) ;=> (1 2 ())
    (if-match [[[?key ?value] & ?rest] (sorted-map 1 2, 3 4)] [key value rest]) ;=> (1 2 ([3 4]))

Failing matches
    
    (if-match [[?fst & ?rst] []] [fst rst] :failed-match) ;=> :failed-match
    (if-match [[[?key ?value] & ?rest] (sorted-map)] [key value rest]) ;=> nil
    
### Destructuring Maps

Map literals look up corresponding values by key and check the value of the given map against the pattern value of the pattern map.

    (if-match [{:foo java.lang.String} {:foo "bar"}] true) ;=> true
    (if-match [{:foo java.lang.String} (sorted-map :foo "bar")] true) ;=>

Keys that aren't pattern matched are ignored

    (if-match [{:foo java.lang.String} {:foo "bar", :baz "qux"}] true) ;=> true

Assoc lists aren't currently supported

    (if-match [{:foo java.lang.String} [[:foo "bar"]]] true) ;=> nil
    
### Expressions

Lists are evaluated as clojure expressions, with `?` being substituted for the matched-against value. For example, to check for an odd integer, you would use

    (if-match [(odd? ?) 1] true) ;=> true


### Special forms

Not all lists are left as-is. Matchure has an extensible set of special forms. Right now, the special forms just include `quote` and boolean operators, `and`, `or`, and `not`.

One common use of `and` is to test a value and bind it to a variable if the test succeeds:

    (if-match [(and ?foo #"hello") "hello world"] foo) ;=> "hello world"
    (if-match [(and ?foo #"hello") "goodbye world"] foo) ;=> nil

Or and not also supported. To assert the matched value is a string either doesn't match `#"hello"` or matches both `#"hello"` and `#"world"`:

    (if-match [(or (not #"hello") #"world") "hello world"] true) ;=> true
    (if-match [(or (not #"hello") #"world") "whatever"] true) ;=> true
    (if-match [(or (not #"hello") #"world") "hello everyone"] true) ;=> nil

#### Quote

Quote allows you to escape what would otherwise be a pattern so it's tested for equality instead.

### when-match and cond-match

You can also use `when-match`

    (when-match [[?fst & ?rst] (list 1 2)]
      (prn "asdf")
      (prn "ghjkl"))

`cond-match` allows you to either test one value against multiple patterns

    (cond-match "hello, world"
      #"foo" "matches foo"
      #"hello" "matches hello"
      ? "doesn't match either") ;=> "matches hello"

Or match multiple values against multiple patterns

    (let [s "hello world"]
      (cond-match
        [#"foo" s] "matches foo"
        [#"hello" s] "matches hello"
        [? s] "doesn't match either")) ;=> "matches hello"

### fn-match and defn-match

`fn-match` and `defn-match` work like the corresponding builtins, but
match their patterns. They support both the (fn [& args] body) and (fn
([& arglist1] body1)...) variants. An IllegalArgumentException is
raised if either the number of arguments does not fit any provided
pattern or the particular specified arguments do not fit any
pattern. `fn-match` and `defn-match` define multi-arity functions
behind the scenes and only test patterns that could conceivably match
a call of a given arity.

`fn-match` defines anonymous functions that pattern match on
arguments:

    (fn-match this
      ([0] 1)
      ([1] 1)
      ([?n] (+ (this (dec n)) (this (dec (dec n))))))

`defn-match` works similarly:

    (defn-match fib
      ([0] 1)
      ([1] 1)
      ([?n] (+ (fib (dec n)) (fib (dec (dec n))))))
